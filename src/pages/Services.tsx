          Computers have simplified the task of analyzing vast amounts of data, and they can be invaluable aids in HR management, from payroll processing to record retention. With computer hardware, software, and databases, organizations can keep records and information better, as well as retrieve them with greater ease. Information Technology (IT) as a structural factor and instrument transforms architects of organizations, business processes and communication and is increasingly integrated into Human Resource Management. While IT is having impact on HR, the managers, employees, customers and suppliers increase their expectancies for HR functions.

          The Very Small Aperture Terminal is a one-way or two-way satellite ground station consisting of a dish antenna smaller than three meters across. The VSAT's function is to access the signal from a specific orbiting satellite, at which the antenna is pointed, and relay data back and forth from other terminals and hubs. VSAT systems are attractive where the coverage area is large, where quick installation is required and where terrestrial alternatives are difficult to organize.
          <br /><br />
          Because of the convenient size, VSAT technology has made satellite communication an attractive and viable option for a wide range of industrial applications, including mobile communications and broadband VSAT. It works in conjunction with the iDirect Modem.
